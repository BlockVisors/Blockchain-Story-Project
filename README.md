# The Story DAO

The Story is a web application with input fields (text and image) where users who have [MetaMask]
(https://bitfalls.com/2018/02/16/metamask-send-receive-ether/) installed can send in a paragraph of text or an image, depending on certain conditions (image only appears once every 50 paragraphs and can only be a URL). 

The full story is rendered next to the input fields. The more entries exist in the story, the more expensive it is to submit an entry.  Submitting an entry is an action available to everyone who pays the fee and has at least one TNS token.

More info soon.
